# 🪙 Decentralized Lottery System

## 📖 Project Description
The **Decentralized Lottery System** is a blockchain-based smart contract that allows participants to enter a lottery by sending Ether. The winner is selected randomly and automatically rewarded with the entire lottery pool. This system ensures **transparency**, **trust**, and **tamper-proof randomness** using Ethereum smart contracts.

---

## 🌍 Project Vision
To build a **fair**, **secure**, and **transparent** lottery mechanism that operates without the need for a central authority — empowering users with full control and verifiable outcomes on the blockchain.

---

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Decentralized & Transparent:** All transactions and results are stored on-chain for public verification.  
- **Random Winner Selection:** Uses pseudo-random generation logic for winner determination.  
- **Automatic Payouts:** The smart contract transfers the balance to the winner instantly.  
- **Manager Control:** Only the contract manager can start and end the lottery to ensure fairness.

---

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Integrate with **Chainlink VRF** for truly random and tamper-proof winner selection.  
- Add a **frontend dApp interface** for user-friendly participation.  
- Include **multiple rounds and jackpot features**.  
- Allow **token-based participation** instead of Ether.  
- Implement **automated lottery scheduling** using Chainlink Keepers.
